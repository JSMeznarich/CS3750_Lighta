# CS3750 - The Elon Muskers
This is my project for my CS3750 class. We worked as a team to complete this project through the semester. It is a LMS system similar to Canvas or Blackboard were students and sign up for class and pay tuition, and complete file upload assignment or text based submissions. The professors can create new courses or class for students to sign up for as well as grading assignments. Somethings, not all, that I did was taking a picture the students uploaded and convert it to binary to be stored in a SQL database, and get the binary and turn it back into a picture when it was needed. I was also able to display useful graphs for the professors that tell give them information on how students are doing in the class and also how well they are doing on an assignment.
